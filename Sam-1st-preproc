##### NOTES
## this needs to be in a directory which also contains the CUB_200_2011 file and the bird_labs.csv to run
## crops the images to the bounding boxes provided, no parts are pinpointed on to the birds.
## splits the images into the numpy array and its label
## creates train and test (validation can be added in keras model)
## may have trouble with the tensorflow package import, ensure it is downloaded correctly

## crop size is changable by x_crop and y_crop variables (set to 50x50 pixels)
## can rotate/flip the images to provide extra images if more are required to get better accuracy
## 8 of the 11788 images are greyscale, so have I removed these as they cause problems in code and are insignificant
## y_train has length 201, as the id's start at 1 but the encoding method includes 0, so can ignore, or possibly remove if needed

## should take around 5-10 minutes to run

## get current directory

## iterate through the rows of the csv, to obtained cropped and resized image, and labels

## convert IDs list to numpy array and the convert labels to binary arrays (one-hot coding)

## rejoin image-array and binary label as tuple into the numpy_label_data list

## shuffle data 
shuffle(numpy_label_data)  

## removes the grey scale images *as shape is (50,50) not (50,50,3)*

## create X and y sets
for i in numpy_label_data:

## Create train and test set, then create validation set from the train set (gives 7544 train, 1886 val, 2358 test)

#  this line is #'d out, as you can include validation set in the keras models when fittting, can include here if you want

## normalizes the RGB values to 0-1 instead of 0-255, and converts lists into numpy array 
X_train = np.asarray(pre_X_train)/255
X_test = np.asarray(pre_X_test)/255

y_train = np.asarray(pre_y_train)
y_test = np.asarray(pre_y_test)

## print to show example for format of the output of each variable
print('X_train example:','\n',X_train[0],'\n\n','y_train example:','\n',y_train[0])
plt.imshow(X_train[0])
plt.show()
